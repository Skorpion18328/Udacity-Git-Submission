### Project Title
Repo generated as part of "Introduction to Version Control" Final Project
The project uploaded is the Bikeshare Data Analysis Project as part of Udacity's Programming for Data Science with Python program

### Description
bikeshare.py is a short Python script that will take the supplied data on Bikeshare usage in Chicago, NYC, and Washington (unclear whether it was DC or the state) and provide a number of analyses, such as travel times, route/trip information, customer types, and demographic information (if available). It will also provide output of raw data in small chunks at the request of the user.
